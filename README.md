# odin-etch-a-sketch

Project to create a Etch-a-Sketch Website.

I learned a lot doing this Project, especially about eventListeners in JavaScript. Learned to create functions and use them. Creation of elements in the DOM with JavaScript, is also something I learned aswell as deleating them, changing the style, attributes or the innerText.
